API Homework - Week 6

What we can observe from the analysis of the data is the following:

* The graph of Latitude vs Temparature show us how the temperatures are deacresing as the latitud increases due to the fact that the south hemisphere is now in summer time and the north hemisphere is in winther time. However as we wanted to prove, coordenates close to the (0,0) do not have very low temperatures.

* We can also look from the graph of Latitude vs Humidity, that the humidity is mainly concentrated in the coordinates above the (0,0) and as the cities are more in the south, the humidity spreads more, eventhough there are points with high levels of humidity.

* From the graph Latitude vs Wind Speed, we can observe that most of the concentration is between 0 and 10 mph and the only pattern related to the latitud is that the highest levels of wind speed are located ih the cities with highest latitude, which again might be caused for the winter season in which those cities are this time of the year.
